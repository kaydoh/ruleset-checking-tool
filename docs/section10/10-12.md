# Airside systems â€“ Rule 10-12

**Rule ID:** 10-12
 
**Rule Description:** For HVAC systems designed, mechanical heating equipment efficiencies shall be adjusted from actual design conditions to the standard rating conditions. 
**Rule Assertion:** P-RMR = expected value                                           
**Appendix G Section:** Table G3.1 Section 10 b. 
**Appendix G Section Reference:** None
**Data Lookup:** None  
**Evaluation Context:** Evaluate each HeatingVentilationAirAconditioningSystem  

**Applicability Checks:** 

1. HVAC with mechanical heating.

**Function Call:** None

**Manual Check:** 

 1. Check that the mechanical equipment heating efficiency has been adjusted from actual design conditions to standard rating conditions.  


**Rule Logic:**
**Applicability Check 1:** 
- For each building segment in the P_RMR: `for building_segment_p in P_RMR:`
    - For each hvac system in the building segment: `for hvac_p in bulding_segment_p:`
        - Reset heating efficiency tracker: `heating_eff_tracker = 0`
        - Reset rule applicablility flag: `rule_applicability_flag = FALSE`
        - For each heating system in the HVAC system: `for heating_system_p in hvac_p:`
            - Check that heating system type does not equal None: `if heating_system_p.heating_system_type != "None":`
                - Get the full load heating efficiency: `full_load_efficiency_p = cooling_system_p.full_load_efficiency`
                - Set applicability flag to true: `rule_applicability_flag = TRUE`
                # This will make the efficiency equal the lowest modeled efficiency in the baseline if multiple are modeled
                - Check if the tracker equals 0 if so then assign efficiency: `if heating_eff_tracker == 0: heating_eff_tracker = full_load_efficiency_p`
                - Check if the tracker is less than the efficiency, if so assign tracker to efficiency value: `if full_load_efficiency_p < heating_eff_tracker: heating_eff_tracker = full_load_efficiency_p`
        - For each preheat system in the HVAC system: `for preheat_system_p in hvac_p:`
            - Check that preheating system type does not equal None: `if preheat_system_p.heating_system_type != "None": `
                - Get the full load heating efficiency: `full_load_efficiency_p = preheat_system_p.full_load_efficiency`
                - Set applicability flag to true: `rule_applicability_flag = TRUE`
                # This will make the efficiency equal the lowest modeled efficiency in the baseline if multiple are modeled
                - Check if the tracker equals 0 if so then assign efficiency: `if heating_eff_tracker == 0: heating_eff_tracker = full_load_efficiency_p`
                - Check if the tracker is less than the efficiency, if so assign tracker to efficiency value: `if full_load_efficiency_p < heating_eff_tracker: heating_eff_tracker = full_load_efficiency_p`     
         - Check if applicability flag equals true, if true proceed: `if rule_applicability_flag == TRUE:` 
                **Rule Assertion:**
                - Case 1: For each applicable hvac system, outcome is undetermined, manual check needs to be performed: `UNDETERMINED`

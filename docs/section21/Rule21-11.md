# Boiler - Rule 21-11  

**Rule ID:** 21-11  
**Rule Description:** When the system uses boilers the hot water system shall be modeled as primary only with continuous variable flow and a minimum turndown of 25%.  
**Rule Assertion:** B-RMR  
**Appendix G Section:** Section 21 Boiler  
**Appendix G Section Reference:** Section G3.1.3.5 Building System-Specific Modeling Requirements for the Baseline model  

**Applicability:** All required data elements exist for B_RMR  
**Applicability Checks:**  

1. B-RMR is modeled with at least one air-side system that is Type-1, 5, 7, 11, or 12
2. B-RMR is not modeled with purchased heating.

**Manual Check:** None  
**Evaluation Context:** Building  
**Data Lookup:** None  
**Function Call:** None  

**Applicability Checks:**  

1. B-RMR is modeled with at least one air-side system that is Type-1, 5, 7, 11, or 12: `if PLACEHOLDER_AIRSIDE_SYSTEM_RULE-X-XX:`
2. B-RMR is not modeled with purchased heating: `if NOT Rule-21-1:`

## Rule Logic:  

- For each fluid loop in B_RMR: `for fluid_loop_b in B_RMR.ASHRAE229.fluid_loops:`

  - Check if fluid loop is heating type: `if fluid_loop_b.type == "HEATING":`

    **Rule Assertion:**

    - Case 1: For heating hot water loop, if loop is modeled as primary only with continuous variable flow and a minimum turndown of 25%: `if ( NOT fluid_loop_b.child_loops ) AND ( fluid_loop_b.heating_design_and_control.flow_control == "VARIABLE_FLOW" ) AND ( fluid_loop_b.heating_design_and_control.minimum_flow_fraction == 0.25 ): PASS`

    - Case 2: Else: `else: FAIL`

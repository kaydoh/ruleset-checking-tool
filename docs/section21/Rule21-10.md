# Boiler - Rule 21-10  

**Rule ID:** 21-10  
**Rule Description:** When the building uses boilers, the hot water pump shall be modeled as riding the pump curve if the hot water system serves less than 120,000 ft^2 otherwise it shall be modeled with a VFD.  
**Rule Assertion:** B-RMR  
**Appendix G Section:** Section 21 Boiler  
**Appendix G Section Reference:** Section G3.1.3.5 Building System-Specific Modeling Requirements for the Baseline model  

**Applicability:** All required data elements exist for B_RMR  
**Applicability Checks:**  

1. B-RMR is not modeled with purchased heating.

**Manual Check:** None  
**Evaluation Context:** Building  
**Data Lookup:** None  
**Function Call:** None  

**Applicability Checks:**  

1. B-RMR is not modeled with purchased heating: `if Rule-21-1 == "NOT APPLICABLE":`

## Rule Logic:  

- For each zone in B_RMR: `for zone_b in B_RMR...zones:`

  - Check if zone has HVAC terminals, get zone terminals: `if zone_b.terminals: zone_terminals_b = zone_b.terminals`

    - For each zone terminal: `for zone_terminal_b in zone_terminals_b:`

      - Check if zone area has not been added to any heating hot water loop: `if NOT zone_flag:`

        - Get HVAC system serving the terminal: `hvac_b = zone_b.terminals.served_by_heating_ventilation_air_conditioning_systems`

          - Get heating system from HVAC system: `heating_system_b = hvac_b.heating_system`

            - Check if heating system has heating hot water loop, get heating hot water loop: `if heating_system_b.hot_water_loop: hhw_loop_b = heating_system_b.hot_water_loop`

              - Save zone area to heating hot water loop: `loop_area_dict[hhw_loop_b] += sum(space.floor_area for space in zone_b.spaces)`

              - Set zone flag as True to avoid double counting the zone area: `zone_flag == TRUE`

- For each pump in B-RMR: `for pump_b in B_RMR.ASHRAE229.pumps:`

  - Check if pump serves heating hot water loop: `if pump_b.loop_or_piping.type == "HEATING":`

    - Check if heating hot water loop serves less than 120,000 ft^2, set target pump type to riding the pump curve: `if loop_area_dict(pump_b.loop_or_piping) < 120000: target_pump_type == "FIXED_SPEED"`

    - Else, heating hot water loop serves 120,000 ft^2 or more, set target pump type to variable speed: `else: target_pump_type == "VARIABLE_SPEED"`

      **Rule Assertion - Component:**

      - Case 1: For heating hot water loop, if the hot water pump is modeled as riding the pump curve when the hot water system serves less than 120,000 ft^2, or modeled with a VFD when the hot water system serves more than or equal to 120,000 ft^2: `if pump_b.speed_control == target_pump_type: PASS`

      - Case 3: Else, save component ID to output array for failed components:: `else: FAIL and failed_components_array.append(pump_b)`

**Rule Assertion - RMR:**

- Case 1: If all components pass: `if ALL_COMPONENTS == PASS: PASS`

- Case 2: Else, list all failed components' ID: `else: FAIL and raise_message ${failed_components_array}`

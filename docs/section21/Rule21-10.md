# Boiler - Rule 21-10  

**Rule ID:** 21-10  
**Rule Description:** When the building uses boilers, the hot water pump shall be modeled as riding the pump curve if the hot water system serves less than 120,000 ft^2 otherwise it shall be modeled with a VFD.  
**Rule Assertion:** B-RMR  
**Appendix G Section:** Section 21 Boiler  
**Appendix G Section Reference:** Section G3.1.3.5 Building System-Specific Modeling Requirements for the Baseline model  

**Applicability:** All required data elements exist for B_RMR  
**Applicability Checks:**  

1. P-RMR is not modeled with purchased heating.
2. B-RMR is modeled with at least one air-side system that is Type-1a, 7, 11, 12 or that is Type-1, 5, 7, 11, 12.

**Manual Check:** None  
**Evaluation Context:** Building  
**Data Lookup:** None  
**Function Call:**  

1. check_purchased_chw_hhw()
2. get_loop_zone_list_w_area()

**Applicability Checks:**  

1. Check if P-RMR is modeled with purchased cooling or purchased hot water/steam: `purchased_chw_hhw_status_dict = check_purchased_chw_hhw(P_RMR)`

  - If P-RMR is modeled with purchased hot water/steam, rule is not applicable: `if purchased_chw_hhw_status_dict["PURCHASED_HEATING"]: rule_applicability_flag = FALSE`

  - Else, P-RMR is not modeled with purchased hot water/steam, continue to next applicability check: `if NOT purchased_chw_hhw_status_dict["PURCHASED_HEATING"]:`

2. B-RMR is modeled with at least one air-side system that is Type-1a, 7, 11, 12 or that is Type-1, 5, 7, 11, 12:

  - If P-RMR is not modeled with purchased cooling: `if NOT purchased_chw_hhw_status_dict["PURCHASED_COOLING"]:`

    - Check if B-RMR is modeled with at least one air-side system that is Type-1, 5, 7, 11 or 12, continue to rule logic: `PLACEHOLDER`

    - Else, rule is not applicable: `else: rule_applicability_flag = FALSE`

  - Else, P-RMR is modeled with purchased cooling: `else:`

    - Check if B-RMR is modeled with at least one air-side system that is Type-1a, 7, 11 or 12, continue to rule logic: `PLACEHOLDER`

    - Else, rule is not applicable: `else: rule_applicability_flag = FALSE`

## Rule Logic:  

- Get dictionary that saves the list of zones and the total floor area served by each CHW or HHW loop: `loop_zone_list_w_area_dict = get_loop_zone_list_w_area(B_RMR)`

- For each pump in B-RMR: `for pump_b in B_RMR.ASHRAE229.pumps:`

  - Check if pump serves heating hot water loop: `if pump_b.loop_or_piping.type == "HEATING":`

    - Check if heating hot water loop serves less than 120,000 ft^2, set target pump type to riding the pump curve: `if loop_area_dict(pump_b.loop_or_piping) < 120000: target_pump_type == "FIXED_SPEED"`

    - Else, heating hot water loop serves 120,000 ft^2 or more, set target pump type to variable speed: `else: target_pump_type == "VARIABLE_SPEED"`

      **Rule Assertion - Component:**

      - Case 1: For heating hot water loop, if the hot water pump is modeled as riding the pump curve when the hot water system serves less than 120,000 ft^2, or modeled with a VFD when the hot water system serves more than or equal to 120,000 ft^2: `if pump_b.speed_control == target_pump_type: PASS`

      - Case 2: Else, save component ID to output array for failed components:: `else: FAIL and failed_components_array.append(pump_b)`

**Rule Assertion - RMR:**

- Case 1: If all components pass: `if ALL_COMPONENTS == PASS: PASS`

- Case 2: Else, list all failed components' ID: `else: FAIL and raise_message ${failed_components_array}`

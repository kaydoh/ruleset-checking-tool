**Rule ID:** 21-10  
**Rule Description:** When the building uses boilers, the hot water pump shall be modeled as riding the pump curve if the hot water system serves less than 120,000 ft^2 otherwise it shall be modeled with a VFD.  
**Rule Assertion:** B-RMR  
**Appendix G Section:** Section 21 Boiler  
**Appendix G Section Reference:** Section G3.1.3.5 Building System-Specific Modeling Requirements for the Baseline model  

**Applicability:** All required data elements exist for B_RMR  
**Applicability Checks:**  

1. B-RMR is modeled with at least one air-side system that is Type-1, 5, 7, 11, or 12
2. B-RMR is not modeled with purchased heating.
3. Pass Rule 21-11.
4. Pass Rule 21-18.

**Manual Check:** None  
**Evaluation Context:** Building  
**Data Lookup:** None  
**Function Call:**

1. get_total_conditioned_area_served_by_loop() (See Note#2)

**Applicability Checks:**  

1. B-RMR is modeled with at least one air-side system that is Type-1, 5, 7, 11, or 12: `PLACEHOLDER`
2. B-RMR is not modeled with purchased heating: `if Rule-21-1 == "NOT APPLICABLE":`
3. Pass Rule 21-11: `if Rule-21-11 == "PASS":`
4. Pass Rule 21-18: `if Rule-21-18 == "PASS":`

## Rule Logic:  

- For each pump in B-RMR: `for pump_b in B_RMR.ASHRAE229.pumps:`

  - Check if pump serves heating hot water loop: `if pump_b.loop_or_piping.type == "HEATING":`

    - Check if heating hot water loop serves less than 120,000 ft^2, set target pump type to riding the pump curve: `if get_total_conditioned_area_served_by_loop(pump_b.loop_or_piping) < 120000: target_pump_type == "FIXED_SPEED"`

    - Else, heating hot water loop serves 120,000 ft^2 or more, set target pump type to variable speed: `else: target_pump_type == "VARIABLE_SPEED"`

**Rule Assertion:**

- Case 1: For heating hot water loop, if the hot water pump is modeled as riding the pump curve when the hot water system serves less than 120,000 ft^2, or modeled with a VFD when the hot water system serves more than or equal to 120,000 ft^2: `if pump_b.speed_control == target_pump_type: PASS`

- Case 3: Else: `else: FAIL`

**Note:**

1. Do we need a separate rule to check if there is just one pump per HHW loop?
2. Is this 12,000sqft conditioned area or all areas served by the loop? Or maybe the question is if a zone is served by a heating system in the proposed design but the heating output is less than the threshold in Table 3.2.

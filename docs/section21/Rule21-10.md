# Boiler - Rule 21-10  

**Rule ID:** 21-10  
**Rule Description:** When the building uses boilers the hot water pump shall be modeled as riding the pump curve if the hot water system serves less than 120,000 ft^2 otherwise it shall be modeled with a VFD.  
**Rule Assertion:** B-RMR  
**Appendix G Section:** Section 21 Boiler  
**Appendix G Section Reference:** Section G3.1.3.5 Building System-Specific Modeling Requirements for the Baseline model  

**Applicability:** All required data elements exist for B_RMR  
**Applicability Checks:**  

1. B-RMR is modeled with at least one air-side system that is Type-1, 5, 7, 11, or 12
2. B-RMR is not modeled with purchased heating.

**Manual Check:** None  
**Evaluation Context:** Building  
**Data Lookup:** None  
**Function Call:** None  

**Applicability Checks:**  

1. B-RMR is modeled with at least one air-side system that is Type-1, 5, 7, 11, or 12: `if PLACEHOLDER_AIRSIDE_SYSTEM_RULE-X-XX:`
2. B-RMR is not modeled with purchased heating: `if NOT Rule-21-1:`

## Rule Logic:  

- For each zone in B_RMR: `for zone_b in B_RMR...zones:`

  - Check if zone has HVAC terminals, get zone terminals: `if zone_b.terminals: zone_terminals_b = zone_b.terminals`

    - For each zone terminal: `for zone_terminal_b in zone_terminals_b:`

      - Check if zone area has not been added to any heating hot water loop: `if NOT zone_flag:`

        - Get HVAC system serving the terminal: `hvac_b = zone_b.terminals.served_by_heating_ventilation_air_conditioning_systems`

          - Get heating system from HVAC system: `heating_system_b = hvac_b.heating_system`

            - Check if heating system has heating hot water loop, get heating hot water loop from heating system: `if heating_system_b.hot_water_loop: hhw_loop_b = heating_system_b.hot_water_loop`

              - Save zone area to heating hot water loop: `hhw_loop_total_area += sum(space.floor_are for space in zone_b.spaces)`

              - Set zone flag as True to avoid double counting the zone area: `zone_flag == TRUE`

- For each pump in B-RMR: `for pump_b in B_RMR.ASHRAE229.pumps:`

  - Check if pump serves heating hot water loop: `if pump_b.loop_or_piping == hhw_loop_b:`

    - Check if heating hot water loop serves less than 120,000 ft^2, set pump type to riding the pump curve: `if hhw_loop_total_area < 120000: pump_type == "RIDING_CURVE"`

    - Else, heating hot water loop serves 120,000 ft^2 or more, set pump type to variable speed: `else: pump_type == "VFD"`

**Rule Assertion:**

- Case 1: For heating hot water loop, if loop serves less than 120,000 ft^2: `if pump_type == "RIDING_CURVE": PASS`

- Case 2: else if loop serves 120,000 ft^2 or more: `else if pump_type == "VFD": PASS`

- Case 3: Else: `else: FAIL`

**Note:**

1. Do we need to check if there is just one pump per HHW loop?
2. Do we need to check if each B-RMR zone only has one terminal, and each terminal only has one HVAC system, e.g. Line 32?
4. Do we need to check if heating system is properly connected to HHW loop, e.g. Line 38?
3. Do we need to count indirectly conditioned zones in total area?

# Boiler - Rule 21-11B  

**Rule ID:** 21-11B  
**Rule Description:** When the system uses boilers the hot water system shall be modeled with continuous variable flow.  
**Rule Assertion:** B-RMR  
**Appendix G Section:** Section 21 Boiler  
**Appendix G Section Reference:** Section G3.1.3.5 Building System-Specific Modeling Requirements for the Baseline model  

**Applicability:** All required data elements exist for B_RMR  
**Applicability Checks:**  

1. B-RMR is not modeled with purchased heating.

**Manual Check:** None  
**Evaluation Context:** Building  
**Data Lookup:** None  
**Function Call:** None  

**Applicability Checks:**  

1. B-RMR is not modeled with purchased heating: `if Rule-21-1 == "NOT APPLICABLE":`

## Rule Logic:  

- For each boiler in B_RMR, save boiler to loop boiler dictionary: `for boiler_b in B_RMR.ASHRAE229.boilers: loop_boiler_dict[boiler_b.loop].append(boiler_b)`

- For each fluid loop in B_RMR: `for fluid_loop_b in B_RMR.ASHRAE229.fluid_loops:`

  - Check if fluid loop is connected to boiler(s): `if fluid_loop_b in loop_boiler_dict.keys()`

    **Rule Assertion - Component:**

    - Case 1: For heating hot water loop that boiler serves, if loop is modeled with continuous variable flow: `if ( fluid_loop_b.heating_design_and_control.flow_control == "VARIABLE_FLOW" ) AND ( fluid_loop_b.operation == "CONTINUOUS" ): PASS`

    - Case 2: Else, save component ID to output array for failed components:: `else: FAIL and failed_components_array.append(fluid_loop_b)`

**Rule Assertion - RMR:**

- Case 1: If all components pass: `if ALL_COMPONENTS == PASS: PASS`

- Case 2: Else, list all failed components' ID: `else: FAIL and raise_message ${failed_components_array}`

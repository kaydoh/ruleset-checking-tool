# CHW&CW - Rule 22-34  

**Rule ID:** 22-34  
**Rule Description:** Baseline chilled water system that does not use purchased chilled water must only have no more than one CHW plant.  
**Rule Assertion:** B-RMR = expected value  
**Appendix G Section:** Section 22 CHW&CW Loop  
**Appendix G Section Reference:** Section G3.1.3.2 Building System-Specific Modeling Requirements for the Baseline model  

**Applicability:** All required data elements exist for B_RMR  
**Applicability Checks:**  

1. B-RMR is not modeled with purchased chilled water.

**Manual Check:** None  
**Evaluation Context:** Building  
**Data Lookup:** None  
**Function Call:** None  

**Applicability Checks:**  

1. B-RMR is not modeled with purchased chilled water: `if Rule-18-8 == "NOT APPLICABLE":`

## Rule Logic:  

- For each chiller in B_RMR, save chiller to loop-chiller dictionary: `for chiller_b in B_RMR.ASHRAE229.chillers: loop_chiller_dict[chiller_b.cooling_loop].append(chiller_b)`

**Rule Assertion - RMR:**

- Case 1: If only one CHW plant is modeled: `if loop_chiller_dict.keys().length == 1: PASS`

- Case 2: Else: `else: FAIL`

**Notes:**

1. TBD if one loop per building, or change Case 2 to UNDETERMINED.

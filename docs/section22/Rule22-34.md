# CHW&CW - Rule 22-34  

**Rule ID:** 22-34  
**Rule Description:** Baseline chilled water system that does not use purchased chilled water must only have no more than one CHW plant.  
**Rule Assertion:** B-RMR = expected value  
**Appendix G Section:** Section 22 CHW&CW Loop  
**Appendix G Section Reference:** Section G3.1.3.2 Building System-Specific Modeling Requirements for the Baseline model  

**Applicability:** All required data elements exist for B_RMR  
**Applicability Checks:**  

1. B-RMR is modeled with at least one air-side system that is Type-7, 8, 11, 12, or 13.
2. B-RMR is not modeled with purchased chilled water.

**Manual Check:** None  
**Evaluation Context:** Building  
**Data Lookup:** None  
**Function Call:** None  

**Applicability Checks:**  

1. B-RMR is modeled with at least one air-side system that is Type-7, 8, 11, 12, or 13: `PLACEHOLDER`
2. B-RMR is not modeled with purchased chilled water: `if Rule-18-8 == "NOT APPLICABLE":`

## Rule Logic:  

- For each chiller in B_RMR: `for chiller_b in B_RMR.ASHRAE229.chillers:`

  - Get cooling loop that chiller serves: `chw_loop_b = chiller_b.cooling_loop`

    - If cooling loop has not been saved in primary CHW loop array, save cooling loop to primary CHW loop array: `if NOT chw_loop_b in primary_chw_loop_array: primary_chw_loop_array.append(chw_loop_b)`

  **Rule Assertion:**

  - Case 1: If only one CHW plant is modeled: `if primary_chw_loop_array.length == 1: PASS`

  - Case 2: Else: `else: FAIL`

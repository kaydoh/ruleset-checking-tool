**Rule ID:** 22-11  
**Rule Description:** For Baseline chilled-water system that does not use purchased chilled water and does not serve System-11 with an integrated fluid economizer, variable-flow secondary pump shall be modeled as 13W/gpm at design conditions.  
**Rule Assertion:** B-RMR = expected value  
**Appendix G Section:** Section 22 CHW&CW Loop  
**Appendix G Section Reference:** Section G3.1.3.10 Chilled-water supply temperature reset (System 7, 8, 11, 12 and 13)  

**Applicability:** All required data elements exist for B_RMR  
**Applicability Checks:**  

1. B-RMR is not modeled with purchased chilled water.
2. B-RMR is not modeled with System-11 with an integrated fluid economizer.

**Manual Check:** None  
**Evaluation Context:** Building  
**Data Lookup:** None  
**Function Call:** None  

**Applicability Checks:**  

1. B-RMR is not modeled with purchased chilled water: `if Rule-18-8 == "NOT APPLICABLE":`
2. B-RMR is not modeled with System-11 with an integrated fluid economizer: `PLACEHOLDER`

## Rule Logic:  

- For each chiller in B_RMR, save chiller to loop-chiller dictionary: `for chiller_b in B_RMR.ASHRAE229.chillers: loop_chiller_dict[chiller_b.cooling_loop].append(chiller_b)`

- For each CHW loop that chiller serves: `for primary_loop_b in chw_loop_capacity_dict.keys():`

  - For each secondary loop served by primary CHW loop: `for secondary_loop_b in primary_loop_b.child_loops:`

    **Rule Assertion - Component:**

    - Case 1: If secondary pump is modeled as 13W/gpm at design conditions: `if secondary_loop_b.pump_power_per_flow_rate == 13: PASS`

    - Case 2: Else, save component ID to output array for failed components:: `else: FAIL and failed_components_array.append(secondary_pump)`

**Rule Assertion - RMR:**

- Case 1: If all components pass: `if ALL_COMPONENTS == PASS: PASS`

- Case 2: Else, list all failed components' ID: `else: FAIL and raise_message ${failed_components_array}`

**Notes:**

1. Need to add fluid economizer in schema.

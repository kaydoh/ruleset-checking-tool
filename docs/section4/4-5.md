# Airside Systems – Rule 4-5

**Rule ID:** 4-5
 
**Rule Description:** HVAC fans shall remain on during unoccupied hours in spaces that have health and safety mandated minimum ventilation requirements during unoccupied hours.  
**Rule Assertion:** P-RMR = expected value                                           
**Appendix G Section:** Section G3.1-4 Schedules exception #2 for the proposed building  
**Appendix G Section Reference:** None
**Data Lookup:** None 

**Evaluation Context:** Evaluate each HeatingVentilationAirAconditioningSystem  

**Applicability Checks:** 

1. Applies to all HVAC systems that serve zones that have health and safety mandated minimum ventilation requirements during unoccupied hours. 
 
**Function Call:** 

1. get_zones_health_safety_vent_reqs()

**Manual Check:** None  
  
**Rule Logic:**
**Applicability Check 1:** 
- Get list of zones that are likely to have health and safety mandated minimum ventilation requirements during unoccupied hours: `applicable_zones_health_safety_unocc_list_p = get_zones_health_safety_vent_reqs(P_RMR)`
- For each zone in P_RMR: `for zone_p in P_RMR...Zones:`
    - Check if the zone is applicable by checking if the zone is in the list of applicable zones, if yes then proceed and set applicability flag to true: `if zone_p.id in applicable_zones_health_safety_unocc_list_p: health_safety_unocc_check = TRUE`
    - If applicability flag = true then carry on with rule logic: `if health_safety_unocc_check == TRUE:`
        - For each terminal in zone_p: `for terminal_p in zone_p.terminals:`
            - Get HVAC system serving terminal: `hvac_p = terminal_p.served_by_heating_ventilation_air_conditioning_systems`
            - Add to list of heating_ventilation_air_conditioning_systems_p as the code loops through the terminal units: `heating_ventilation_air_conditioning_systems_list_p = heating_ventilation_air_conditioning_systems_list_p.append(heating_ventilation_air_conditioning_systems_p)`                    
        - Add to master list of HVAC system that are applicable to this zone after looping through the terminal units: `applicable_hvac_systems_list_p = applicable_hvac_systems_list_p.append(heating_ventilation_air_conditioning_systems_list_p)`         
- Convert the list of applicable_hvac_systems_list_p to a set and the back to a list to eliminate duplicates after looping through all zones: `applicable_hvac_systems_list_p = list(set(applicable_hvac_systems_list_p))`                             
- For each hvac_p in applicable_hvac_systems_list_p: `for each hvac_p in applicable_hvac_systems_list_p:`                         
    - Get fan operation during unoccupied periods: `operation_during_unoccupied_p = hvac_p.fan_system.operation_during_unoccupied`(Assumes only one fan system per hvac system which was discussed recently and tentative agreement is that there will be one for hvac system)
    **Rule Assertion:**
    - Case 1: For each applicable hvac system, if fan system operation during unoccupied periods is continuous in the P_RMR: `if operation_during_unoccupied_p == “CONTINUOUS”: PASS`
    - Case 2: Else, for each applicable fan system,:`Else: UNDETERMINED and raise_message "THE HVAC SYSTEM SERVES ZONE(S) THAT APPEAR LIKELY TO HAVE HEALTH AND SAFETY MANDATED MINIMUM VENTILATION REQUIREMENTS DURING UNOCCUPIED HOURS AND THEREFORE MAY WARRANT CONTINUOUS OPERATION DURING UNOCCUPIED HOURS PER SECTION G3.1-4 SCHEDULES EXCEPTION #2 FOR THE PROPOSED BUILDING." `

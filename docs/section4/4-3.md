# ASHVAC – Rule 4-3

**Rule ID:** 4-3
 
**Rule Description:** HVAC Fan Schedules. Schedules for HVAC fans that provide outdoor air for ventilation shall run continuously whenever spaces are occupied.  
**Rule Assertion:** P-RMR = expected value                                           
**Appendix G Section:** Section G3.1-4 Schedules for the proposed building excluding exception #1. 
**Appendix G Section Reference:**  

**Manual Check:** None  
**Evaluation Context:** Evaluate each HeatingVentilationAirAconditioningSystem  
**Data Lookup:** None  
**Function Call:** 

1. get_HVAC_systems_applicable_10cd


**Applicability Checks:** 

1. Call function to get list of inapplicable HVAC systems: `inapplicable_HVAC_systems_list_p = get_HVAC_systems_applicable_10cd(U_RMR,P_RMR)`
- For each hvac_p in the P_RMR check if it this check is applicable: `for each hvac_p in P_RMR...hvac_systems:`
    - Check if hvac_p is not in the list of inapplicable systems, if it is not found then set applicability flag to true: `if hvac_p not in inapplicable_HVAC_systems_list_p: rule_applicability_flag = TRUE`
    
    **Rule Logic**
    - If rule_applicability_flag = TRUE for hvac_p: `if rule_applicability_flag == TRUE:`
        - For each fan system in hvac_p: `fan_systems_p in hvac_p.fan_systems:`
            - Get operation during occupied periods: `operation_during_occupied_p = fans_systems_p.operation_during_occupied`
            - Get minimum_outdoor_airflow: `minimum_outdoor_airflow_p = fans_systems_p.minimum_outdoor_airflow`

            **Rule Assertion - Component:**
            - Case 1: For each applicable fan system, if fan system operation during occupied periods is continuous and the minimum OA is greater than 0 in the P_RMR: `if operation_during_occupied_p == “CONTINUOUS” and minimum_outdoor_airflow_p >0 : PASS`
            - Case 2: else if, fan system operation during occupied periods is cycling and the minimum OA equals 0 in the P_RMR: `else if operation_during_occupied_p == “CYCLING” and minimum_outdoor_airflow_p == 0 : UNDETERMINED`

            - Case 3: Else:`Else: FAIL`

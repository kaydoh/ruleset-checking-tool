# Airside Systems – Rule 4-4

**Rule ID:** 4-4
**Rule Description:** Where no heating and/or cooling system is to be installed, and a heating or cooling system is being simulated only to meet the requirements described in Section G3.1-10 HVAC Systems proposed column c and d, heating and/or cooling system fans shall simulated to be cycled ON and OFF to meet heating and cooling loads during all hours.  
**Rule Assertion:** P-RMR = expected value                                           
**Appendix G Section:** Section G3.1-4 Schedules exception #1 for the proposed building  
**Appendix G Section Reference:** Section G3.1-10 HVAC Systems proposed column c and d
**Data Lookup:** None  
**Evaluation Context:** Evaluate each HeatingVentilationAirAconditioningSystem  
**Applicability Checks:**

1. Applicable if no heating and/or cooling system is to be installed, and a heating or cooling system is being simulated only to meet the requirements described in Section G3.1-10 HVAC Systems proposed column c and d.

**Function Call:** 

1. get_HVAC_systems_applicable_10cd

**Manual Check:** None  

**Rule Logic:**  
**Applicability Check 1:**
- Call function to get list of applicable HVAC systems: `applicable_HVAC_systems_list_p = get_HVAC_systems_applicable_10cd(U_RMR,P_RMR)`
- For each HeatingVentilationAirAconditioningSystem in the P_RMR check if it this check is applicable: `for each hvac_p in P_RMR...hvac_systems:`
    - Check if hvac_p is in the list of applicable systems, if it is found then set applicability flag to true: `if hvac_p in applicable_HVAC_systems_list_p: rule_applicability_flag = TRUE`
    - If rule_applicability_flag = TRUE for hvac_p: `if rule_applicability_flag == TRUE:`
        - For each fan system in hvac_p: `fan_systems_p in hvac_p.fan_systems:`
            - Get operation during occupied periods: `operation_during_occupied_p = fans_systems_p.operation_during_occupied`

            **Rule Assertion:**
            - Case 1: For each applicable fan system, if fan system operation during occupied periods is cycling with load in the P_RMR: `if operation_during_occupied_p == “CYCLING”: PASS`
            - Case 2: For each applicable fan system, save hvac id to output array for failed components, Else:`Else: FAIL`

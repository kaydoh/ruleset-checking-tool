# ASHVAC – Rule 4-4

**Rule ID:** 4-4
 
**Rule Description:** Where no heating and/or cooling system is to be installed, and a heating or cooling system is being simulated only to meet the requirements described in Table G3.1, heating and/or cooling system fans shall not be simulated as running continuously during occupied hours but shall be cycled ON and OFF to meet heating and cooling loads during all hours.  
**Rule Assertion:** P-RMR = expected value                                           
**Appendix G Section:** Section G3.1-4 Schedules exception #1 for the proposed building  
**Appendix G Section Reference:**  

**Applicability:** All required data elements exist for P_RMR  
**Applicability Checks:** 

1. Only applies to HVAC systems that are being simulated only to meet the requirements described in Table G3.1.

**Manual Check:** None  
**Evaluation Context:** Evaluate each data element  
**Data Lookup:** None  
**Function Call:** None

## Rule Logic:

- For each HVAC system in P_RMR: `for hvac_p in P_RMR...heating_ventilation_air_conditioning_systems:`
    - Get HVAC system status: `status_type_p = hvac_p.status_type:`
        - Check if HVAC system status is yet to be designed: `if status_type_p not in [NEW,EXISTING]:`
            - Set applicability flag: `rule_applicability_check = TRUE`
                - For each fan system in each HVAC system that meets the applicabliity check: `fan_systems_p in heating_ventilation_air_conditioning_systems_p.fan_systems:`
                        -   Get fan system unoccupied operation control: `operation_during_occupied_p = fans_systems_p.operation_during_occupied`

**Rule Assertion:**
- Case 1: if fan system operation during occupied periods is cycling with load in the P_RMR: `if operation_during_occupied_p == “CYCLING”: PASS`

- Case 2: Else:`FAIL and raise_message "FANS ARE NOT MODELED AS CYCLING WITH LOAD DURING OCCUPIED HOURS FOR A HEATING OR COOLING SYSTEM THAT IS BEING SIMULATED ONLY TO MEET THE REQUIREMENTS DESCRIBED IN TABLE G3.1 AS EXPECTED PER SECTION G3.1-4 SCHEDULES EXCEPTION #1 FOR THE P-RMR."`

**Applicability Checks:** 

 1. Only applies to HVAC systems that are being simulated only to meet the requirements described in Table G3.1: `if rule_applicability_check: is_applicable = TRUE`

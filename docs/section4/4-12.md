# Airside System - Rule 4-12
**Schema Version:** 0.0.12  
**Mandatory Rule:** True  
**Rule ID:** 4-12  
**Rule Description:** For Systems 6 and 8, only the terminal-unit fan and reheat coil shall be energized to meet heating set point during unoccupied hours.  
**Rule Assertion:** B-RMR = Expected value   
**Appendix G Section:** Section G3.1.2.4      
**90.1 Section Reference:** None  

**Data Lookup:** None  

**Evaluation Context:** Evaluate each HeatingVentilationAirConditioningSystem Data Group

**Applicability Checks:** 

1. Applicable to baseline HVAC systems 6 and 8 only. 

**Function Calls:**  

1. get_baseline_system_types()  
2. get_hvac_zone_list_w_area()  

## Rule Logic:  
**Applicability Check 1:**  
- Get dictionary for finding baseline system types for hvac systems: `baseline_hvac_sys_type_ids_dict_b = get_baseline_system_types(B_RMR)`
- Get dictionary with list of zones associated with each HVAC system: `dict_hvac_sys_zones_served_b = get_hvac_zone_list_w_area(B_RMR)`
- For each hvac system in the B_RMR: `for hvac_b in B_RMR...HeatingVentilationAirConditioningSystem:`
    - Check if system type is of system type 6, 6b, 8, 8a, 8b, or 8c, if yes then carry on with check: `if baseline_hvac_sys_type_ids_dict_b.keys()[list(baseline_hvac_sys_type_ids_dict_b.values()).index(hvac_b.id)] in ["SYS-6, SYS-6b",SYS-8",SYS-8a",SYS-8b",SYS-8c"]:`
        - Reset all terminals unoccupied equals cycling boolean variable to TRUE: `all_terminals_unocc_cycling = TRUE`
        - Get hvac system fan system operation during unoccupied hours: `fan_system_operation_unocc = hvac_b.fan_system[0].operation_during_unoccupied`
        - Get a list of zones served by the HVAC system: `zones_served_b = list(dict_hvac_sys_zones_served_b[hvac_b.id]["Zone_List"].values()))`
        - Loop through each zone served by the hvac system: `For zone_b in zones_served_b:`
            - Loop through each terminal unit associated with each zone and check the operation during unoccupied periods: `For terminal_b in zone_b.terminals:`
                - Check if unoccupied operation is set to cycling, if not then set all_terminals_unocc_cycling boolean variable equal to FALSE: `if terminal_b.operation_during_unoccupied != "CYCLING": all_terminals_unocc_cycling = FALSE`     
        
        **Rule Assertion:**  
        - Case 1: For applicable hvac system, if the hvac system fan_system_operation_unocc equals "Keep_off" and unoccupied fan control for each associated terminal unit equals "cycling" then pass: `if fan_system_operation_unocc == "KEEP_OFF" AND all_terminals_unocc_cycling == TRUE: outcome == "PASS"`
        - Case 2: Else, for each applicable hvac system: `Else: outcome == "FAIL"`  

**Future Change Note:**
  1. terminal.operation_during_unoccupied needs to b added to the schema and approved by the schema working group.

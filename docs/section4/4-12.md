# Airside System - Rule 4-12
**Schema Version:** 0.0.12  
**Mandatory Rule:** True  
**Rule ID:** 4-12  
**Rule Description:** For Systems 6 and 8, only the terminal-unit fan and reheat coil shall be energized to meet heating set point during unoccupied hours.  
**Rule Assertion:** B-RMR = Expected value   
**Appendix G Section:** Section G3.1.2.4      
**90.1 Section Reference:** None  

**Data Lookup:** None  

**Evaluation Context:** Evaluate each HeatingVentilationAirConditioningSystem Data Group

**Applicability Checks:** 

1. Applicable to baseline HVAC systems 6 and 8 only. 

**Function Calls:**  

1. get_baseline_system_types()  
2. get_hvac_zone_list_w_area()  


## Rule Logic:  
**Applicability Check 1:**  
- Get dictionary for finding baseline system types for hvac systems: `baseline_hvac_sys_type_ids_dict_b = get_baseline_system_types(B_RMR)`
- Get dictionary with list of zones associated with each HVAC system: `dict_hvac_sys_zones_served_b = get_hvac_zone_list_w_area(B_RMR)`
- For each hvac system in the B_RMR: `for hvac_b in B_RMR...HeatingVentilationAirConditioningSystem:`
    - Check if system type is of system type 6, 6b, 8, 8a, 8b, or 8c, if yes then carry on with check: `if Baseline_hvac_sys_type_ids_dict_b.keys()[list(baseline_hvac_sys_type_ids_dict_b.values()).index(hvac_b.id)] in ["SYS-6, SYS-6b",SYS-8",SYS-8a",SYS-8b",SYS-8c"]:`
        - Get fan system operation during unoccupied hours: `fan_system_operation_unocc = hvac_b.fan_system[0].operation_during_unoccupied`
        - Get a list of zones served by the HVAC system: `zones_served_b = list(dict_hvac_sys_zones_served_p[hvac_pr.id]["Zone_List"].values()))

        
    **Rule Assertion:**  
    - Case 1: For each zone, if both humidity schedules for the baseline and proposed are undefined then pass: `if minimum_humidity_stpt_sch_b == Null AND minimum_humidity_stpt_sch_p == Null and maximum_humidity_stpt_sch_b == Null AND maximum_humidity_stpt_sch_p == Null: outcome == "PASS"`
    - Case 2: For each zone, else if the baseline humidity schedule is defined and the proposed humidity schedule is undefined then fail: `elif (minimum_humidity_stpt_sch_b != Null AND minimum_humidity_stpt_sch_p == Null) OR (maximum_humidity_stpt_sch_b != Null AND maximum_humidity_stpt_sch_p == Null) : outcome == "Fail" and raise_message "Fail because a humidity schedule is defined in the B_RMR but not in the P_RMR."`
    - Case 3: For each zone, else if the baseline humidity schedule is undefined and the proposed humidity schedule is defined then fail: `elif (minimum_humidity_stpt_sch_b == Null AND minimum_humidity_stpt_sch_p != Null) OR (maximum_humidity_stpt_sch_b == Null AND maximum_humidity_stpt_sch_p != Null): outcome == "Fail" and raise_message "Fail because a humidity schedule is undefined in the B_RMR but is defined in the P_RMR."`
    - Case 4: For each zone, else if the baseline and proposed humidity schedules match: `elif schedule_mismatch == FALSE: outcome == "PASS"`
    - Case 5: Else, For each zone, humidity schedules do not match: `Else: outcome == "UNDETERMINED" and raise_message "THERE IS A HUMIDITY SCHEDULE MISMATCH BETWEEN THE BASELINE AND PROPOSED RMRs. FAIL UNLESS TABLE G3.1 #4 BASELINE COLUMN EXCEPTION #s 1 and/or 2 ARE APPLICABLE"`  

**Future Change Note:**

  1. zone.minimum_humidity_setpoint_schedule and zone.maximum_humidity_setpoint_schedule need to be approved by the schema working group.

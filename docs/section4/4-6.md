# Airside Systems – Rule 4-6

**Rule ID:** 4-6
**Rule Description:** HVAC fans shall remain on during unoccupied hours in systems primarily serving computer rooms.  
**Rule Assertion:** P-RMR = expected value                                           
**Appendix G Section:** Section G3.1-4 Schedules exception #3 for the proposed building  
**Appendix G Section Reference:** None
**Data Lookup:** None

**Evaluation Context:** Evaluate each HeatingVentilationAirAconditioningSystem 
**Applicability Checks:** 

1. Applies to hvac systems primarily serving computer rooms.

**Function Call:** 

1. get_zones_computer_rooms()
2. get_list_hvac_systems_associated_with_zone()

**Manual Check:** None  
 
**Rule Logic:**
**Applicability Check 1:** 
- Get dictionary with zones with computer room spaces and associated computer room floor area and total zone floor area: `zones_that_include_computer_rooms_dict_p = get_zones_computer_rooms(P_RMR)`
- Get list of zones that include computer rooms: `zones_that_include_computer_rooms_list_p = zones_that_include_computer_rooms_dict_p.keys()`
- For each zone in zones_that_include_computer_rooms_list_p: `for zone_p in zones_that_include_computer_rooms_list_p:`
    - Get list with computer room floor area as first item and the total zone floor area as the second item: `floor_areas_list = zones_that_include_computer_rooms_dict_p[zone_p.id]`
    - Check if computer room floor area is greater than 50% of the total zone floor area, if yes then carry on with the check: `if floor_areas_list[0]/floor_areas_list[1] > 0.5:`
        - Get list of hvac systems associated with this zone by calling the get_list_hvac_systems_associated_with_zone function: `zone_level_applicable_hvac_systems_list_p = get_list_hvac_systems_associated_with_zone(P_RMR,zone_p.id)`                                               
        - Add to master list of HVAC system that are applicable to this check: `applicable_hvac_systems_list_p = applicable_hvac_systems_list_p.append(zone_level_applicable_hvac_systems_list_p)`                    
- Convert the list of applicable_hvac_systems_list_p to a set and the back to a list to eliminate duplicates after looping through all zones:`applicable_hvac_systems_list_p = list(set(applicable_hvac_systems_list_p))`                 
- For each hvac_p in applicable_hvac_systems_list_p: `for each hvac_p in applicable_hvac_systems_list_p:`                         
- Get operation during unoccupied periods: `operation_during_unoccupied_p = hvac_p.fan_systems[0].operation_during_unoccupied`  
**Rule Assertion:**
- Case 1: For each applicable hvac system, if fan system operation during unoccupied periods is continuous in the P_RMR: `if operation_during_unoccupied_p == “CONTINUOUS”: PASS`
- Case 2: Else, for each applicable fan system, save hvac id to output array for failed components: `Else: UNDETERMINED and raise_message "THE HVAC SYSTEM SERVES ZONE(S) THAT INCLUDE COMPUTER ROOMS AND THEREFORE MAY WARRANT CONTINUOUS OPERATION DURING UNOCCUPIED HOURS PER SECTION G3.1-4 SCHEDULES EXCEPTION #3 FOR THE PROPOSED BUILDING. VERIFY WITH A MANUAL CHECK." `

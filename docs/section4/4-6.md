# ASHVAC – Rule 4-6

**Rule ID:** 4-6
 
**Rule Description:** HVAC fans shall remain on during unoccupied hours in systems primarily serving computer rooms.  
**Rule Assertion:** P-RMR = expected value                                           
**Appendix G Section:** Section G3.1-4 exception #3 Schedules for the proposed building  
**Appendix G Section Reference:**  

**Manual Check:** None  
**Evaluation Context:** Evaluate each HeatingVentilationAirAconditioningSystem  
**Data Lookup:** None  
**Function Call:** 

1. get_zones_computer_rooms

**Applicability Checks:** 
- Get list of zones that have computer rooms associated with them: `applicable_zones_list_p = get_zones_computer_rooms(P_RMR)`
- For each zone in P_RMR: `for zone_p in P_RMR...zones:`
    - Check if the zone is applicable, if yes then proceed and set applicability flag to true, if false set outcome to in_applicable: `if zone_p in applicable_zones_list_p:`
        - Set applicability flag to true and carry on with rule logic: `if rule_applicability_check == TRUE:`
   
    **Rule Logic**
    
        - For each terminal in zone_p: `for terminal_p in zone_p.terminals:`
            - Get HVAC system serving terminal: `hvac_p = terminal_p.served_by_heating_ventilation_air_conditioning_systems`
            - Add to list of heating_ventilation_air_conditioning_systems_p as the code loops through the terminal units: `heating_ventilation_air_conditioning_systems_list_p = heating_ventilation_air_conditioning_systems_list_p.append(heating_ventilation_air_conditioning_systems_p)`                    
        - Add to master list of HVAC system that are applicable to this check: `applicable_hvac_systems_list_p = applicable_hvac_systems_list_p.append(heating_ventilation_air_conditioning_systems_list_p)`         
    
    **Rule Assertion - Inapplicable Component:**
    - Else, where zone is not applicable: `else: IN_APPLICABLE and inapplicable_component_list.append(zone_p.id)`

- Convert the list of applicable_hvac_systems_list_p to a set and the back to a list to eliminate duplicates after looping through all zones: 
 `applicable_hvac_systems_list_p = list(set(applicable_hvac_systems_list_p))`                             
  - For each hvac_p in applicable_hvac_systems_list_p: `for each hvac_p in applicable_hvac_systems_list_p:`                         
    - For each fan system in hvac_p: `fan_systems_p in hvac_p.fan_systems:`
        - Reset sublist to blank: `sublist = []`
        - Get operation during unoccupied periods: `operation_during_unoccupied_p = fans_systems_p.operation_during_unoccupied`

                
        **Rule Assertion - Component:**
        - Case 1: For each applicable fan system, if fan system operation during unoccupied periods is continuous in the P_RMR: `if operation_during_unoccupied_p == “CONTINUOUS”: PASS`

        - Case 2: Else, for each applicable fan system, save hvac id to output array for failed components:`Else: FAIL and failed_component_list.append(sublist.append(hvac_p.id,fans_systems_p.id))`

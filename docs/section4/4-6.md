# Airside Systems – Rule 4-6

**Rule ID:** 4-6
**Rule Description:** HVAC fans shall remain on during unoccupied hours in systems primarily serving computer rooms.  
**Rule Assertion:** P-RMR = expected value                                           
**Appendix G Section:** Section G3.1-4 Schedules exception #3 for the proposed building  
**Appendix G Section Reference:** None  
**Data Lookup:** None

**Evaluation Context:** Evaluate each HeatingVentilationAirAconditioningSystem 
**Applicability Checks:** 

1. Applies to hvac systems primarily serving computer rooms.

**Function Call:** 

1. hvac_zone_list_w_area_dictionary()

**Manual Check:** None  
 
**Rule Logic:**  
**Applicability Check 1:** 
- Get dictionary list of zones and the total floor area served by each HVAC system: `hvac_zone_list_w_area_dict_p = hvac_zone_list_w_area_dictionary (P_RMR)`
- For each hvac_p in the P_RMR: `for hvac_p in P_RMR...HeatingVentilationAirConditioningSystem:`
    - Get the total floor area served by the hvac system: `hvac_sys_total_floor_area_p = hvac_zone_list_w_area_dict_p[hvac_p.id]["TOTAL_AREA"]`
    - Reset hvac system includes computer room boolean variable: `hvac_system_serves_computer_room_space = FALSE` 
    - Reset hvac_sys_computer_room_floor_area variable: `hvac_sys_computer_room_floor_area = 0`
    - Get list of zones served by hvac_p: `hvac_zone_list_p = hvac_zone_list_w_area_dict_p[hvac_p.id]["ZONE_LIST"]`
    - For each zone_p in hvac_zone_list_p: `for zone_p in hvac_zone_list_p:`
        - For each space in zone: `for space_p in zone_p.Spaces:`        
            - Check if space is of type computer room, if yes then set the hvac system has computer room boolean variable to true and add the floor area to the total computer room floor area variable for the hvac system: `if space_p.lighting_space_type in ["COMPUTER_ROOM"]:`
                - Set hvac system serves computer room boolean variable to true: `hvac_system_serves_computer_room_space = TRUE`
                - Get space floor_area: `space_floor_area = space_p.floor_area`
                - Add floor area to hvac_sys_computer_room_floor_area: `hvac_sys_computer_room_floor_area = hvac_sys_computer_room_floor_area + space_floor_area`   
    - Check if the hvac system serves computer room boolean variable equals TRUE, if true then proceed otherwise loop to next hvac system: `if hvac_system_serves_computer_room_space == TRUE:`
        - Check if computer room floor area is greater than 50% of the total floor area served by the hvac system, if yes then carry on with the check: `if hvac_sys_computer_room_floor_area/hvac_sys_total_floor_area_p > 0.5:`             
            - Get operation during unoccupied periods: `operation_during_unoccupied_p = hvac_p.fan_systems[0].operation_during_unoccupied`  
            **Rule Assertion:**
            - Case 1: For each applicable hvac system, if fan system operation during unoccupied periods is continuous in the P_RMR: `if operation_during_unoccupied_p == “CONTINUOUS”: PASS`
            - Case 2: Else, for each applicable hvac system system: `Else: UNDETERMINED and raise_message "THE HVAC SYSTEM SERVES ZONE(S) THAT INCLUDE COMPUTER ROOMS AND THEREFORE MAY WARRANT CONTINUOUS OPERATION DURING UNOCCUPIED HOURS PER SECTION G3.1-4 SCHEDULES EXCEPTION #3 FOR THE PROPOSED BUILDING. VERIFY WITH A MANUAL CHECK." `

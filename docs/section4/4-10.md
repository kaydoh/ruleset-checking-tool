# Airside systems – Rule 4-10

**Rule ID:** 4-10  
 
**Rule Description:** Schedules for HVAC fans that provide outdoor air for ventilation shall be cycled ON and OFF to meet heating and cooling loads during unoccupied hours excluding HVAC systems that meet Table G3.1-4 Schedules for the proposed building exceptions #s 2 and 3.  
**Rule Assertion:** P-RMR = expected value                                           
**Appendix G Section:** Table G3.1-4 Schedules for the proposed building excluding exceptions #s 2 and 3  
**Appendix G Section Reference:** None  
**Data Lookup:** None  
**Evaluation Context:** Evaluate each HeatingVentilationAirAconditioningSystem  
**Applicability Checks:**  

1. Not applicable to HVAC systems in which there are health and safety mandated minimum ventilation requirements during unoccupied hours or to HVAC systems primarily serving computer rooms.
 
**Function Call:** 

1. get_zones_computer_rooms()
2. get_zones_health_safety_vent_reqs()

**Manual Check:** None 

**Rule Logic**
**Applicability Checks 1 and 2:** 
- Get list of zones that have computer rooms associated with them: `zones_serving_comp_rooms_list_p = get_zones_computer_rooms(P_RMR)`
- Get list of zones that are likely to have health and safety mandated minimum ventilation requirements during unoccupied hours: `zones_health_safety_unocc_list_p = get_zones_health_safety_vent_reqs(P_RMR)`
- Combine lists and remove duplicates: `inapplicable_zones_list_p = list(set(zones_serving_comp_rooms_list_p + zones_health_safety_unocc_list_p))`
- For each zone in P_RMR: `for zone_p in P_RMR..Zone:`
    - Reset boolean variable that indicates if a zone serves computer room(s) or has health and safety reqs during unocc hours: `zone_serves_comp_room_health_safe_check = FALSE`
    - Check if zone is found in the list of zones serving comp rooms and with health and safety reqs during unocc periods, if NOT found then the zone is applicable to this RDS: `if zone_p.id not in inapplicable_zones_list_p: zone_serves_comp_room_health_safe_check = TRUE`
    - Check if the boolean variable that indicates if a zone serves computer room(s) or has health and safety reqs during unocc hours equals true and if so carry on with rule logic: `if zone_serves_comp_room_health_safe_check == TRUE:`
        - For each terminal in zone_p: `for terminal_p in zone_p.terminals:`
            - Get HVAC system serving terminal: `hvac_p = terminal_p.served_by_heating_ventilation_air_conditioning_systems`
            - Add to list of heating_ventilation_air_conditioning_systems_p as the code loops through the terminal units: `heating_ventilation_air_conditioning_systems_list_p = heating_ventilation_air_conditioning_systems_list_p.append(heating_ventilation_air_conditioning_systems_p)`                    
        - Add to master list of HVAC systems that are applicable to this check after looping through terminal units: `applicable_hvac_systems_list_p = applicable_hvac_systems_list_p.append(heating_ventilation_air_conditioning_systems_list_p)`               
- Convert the list of applicable_hvac_systems_list_p to a set and the back to a list to eliminate duplicates after looping through all zones: `applicable_hvac_systems_list_p = list(set(applicable_hvac_systems_list_p))`                             
- For each hvac_p in applicable_hvac_systems_list_p: `for each hvac_p in applicable_hvac_systems_list_p:`                         
    - Get hvac fan system unoccupied operation control: `operation_during_unoccupied_p = hvac_p.fan_systems[0].operation_during_unoccupied` Assumes only one fan system per hvac unit per recent discussions 2/11/2022  
    **Rule Assertion:**
    - Case 1: For each applicable hvac system, if fan system operation during unoccupied periods is cycling in the P_RMR: `if operation_during_unoccupied_p == “CYCLING”: PASS`
    - Case 2: Else, for each applicable fan system: `Else: FAIL`

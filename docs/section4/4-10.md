# ASHVAC – Rule 4-10

**Rule ID:** 4-10
 
**Rule Description:** HVAC Fan Schedules. Schedules for HVAC fans that provide outdoor air for ventilation shall be cycled ON and OFF to meet heating and cooling loads during unoccupied hours excluding Table G3.1-4 Schedules for the proposed building exceptions #s 2 and 3.  
**Rule Assertion:** P-RMR = expected value                                           
**Appendix G Section:** Table G3.1-4 Schedules for the proposed building excluding exceptions #s 2 and 3 
**Appendix G Section Reference:**  

**Applicability:** All required data elements exist for P_RMR  
**Applicability Checks:** 

1. Does not apply to zones that have health and safety mandated minimum ventilation requirements during unoccupied hours.
2. Does not apply to computer rooms.

**Manual Check:** None  
**Evaluation Context:** Evaluate each data element  
**Data Lookup:** None  
**Function Call:** None

## Rule Logic:

- For each zone in P_RMR: `for zone_p in P_RMR...zones:`
    - Reset applicabliity flag: `rule_applicability_check: is_applicable = TRUE`
    - For each space in zone: `for space_p in zone_p.zones:`
        - Check if space(s) is of type that has health and safety mandated minimum ventilation requirements during unoccupied hours or if space is a computer room: `if space_p.lighting_space_type in [COMPUTER_ROOM,CORRIDOR_HOSPITAL,LABORATORY_EXCEPT_IN_OR_AS_A_CLASSROOM,HEALTHCARE_FACILITY_OPERATING_ROOM]:`
            - Set applicability flag: `rule_applicability_check = FALSE`
    - Check if the applicability flag equals TRUE: `if rule_applicability_check == TRUE:`            
        - For each terminal in zone_p: `for terminal_p in zone_p.terminals:`
            - Get the served_by_heating_ventilation_air_conditioning_systems for each terminal: `heating_ventilation_air_conditioning_systems_p = terminal_p.served_by_heating_ventilation_air_conditioning_systems`
                - Create list of heating_ventilation_air_conditioning_systems_p add to as the code loops through the terminal units: `heating_ventilation_air_conditioning_systems_list_p = heating_ventilation_air_conditioning_systems_list_p.append(heating_ventilation_air_conditioning_systems_p)`                    
    - Convert the list of heating_ventilation_air_conditioning_systems_list_p associated with the zone to a set and the back to a list to eliminate duplicates: `heating_ventilation_air_conditioning_systems_list_p = list(set(heating_ventilation_air_conditioning_systems_list_p))`
    - For each hvac_p in heating_ventilation_air_conditioning_systems_list_p: `for hvac_p in heating_ventilation_air_conditioning_systems_list_p:`                            
        - For each fan system in hvac_p: `for fan_system_p in hvac_p.fan_systems:`
            - Get fan system unoccupied operation control: `operation_during_unoccupied_p = fans_systems_p.operation_during_unoccupied`

            **Rule Assertion:**
            - Case 1: if fan system operation during unoccupied periods is cycling with load in the P_RMR: `if operation_during_unoccupied_p == “CYCLING”: PASS`

            - Case 2: Else:`FAIL and raise_message "FANS ARE NOT MODELED AS CYCLING WITH LOAD DURING UNOCCUPIED HOURS AS EXPECTED."`

**Applicability Checks:** 

 1. Does not apply to zones that have health and safety mandated minimum ventilation requirements during unoccupied hours: `if rule_applicability_check: is_applicable = TRUE`
 2. Does not apply to computer rooms: `if rule_applicability_check: is_applicable = TRUE`

# ASHVAC – Rule 4-10

**Rule ID:** 4-10
 
**Rule Description:** HVAC Fan Schedules. Schedules for HVAC fans that provide outdoor air for ventilation shall be cycled ON and OFF to meet heating and cooling loads during unoccupied hours excluding Table G3.1-4 Schedules for the proposed building exceptions #s 2 and 3.  
**Rule Assertion:** P-RMR = expected value                                           
**Appendix G Section:** Table G3.1-4 Schedules for the proposed building excluding exceptions #s 2 and 3 
**Appendix G Section Reference:**  

**Applicability:** All required data elements exist for P_RMR  
**Applicability Checks:** 

1. Applies to zones in the P-RMR that do not have health and safety mandated minimum ventilation requirements during unoccupied hours.
2. Applies to zones in the P-RMR that are not computer rooms.

**Manual Check:** None  
**Evaluation Context:** Evaluate each data element  
**Data Lookup:** None  
**Function Call:** None

## Rule Logic:

- For each zone in P_RMR: `for zone_p in P_RMR...zones:`
    - Reset applicabliity flag: `rule_applicability_check: is_applicable = TRUE`
    - For each space in zone: `for space_p in zone_p.zones:`
        - Check if space(s) is of type that has health and safety mandated minimum ventilation requirements during unoccupied hours or if space is a computer room: `if space_p.lighting_space_type in [COMPUTER_ROOM,CORRIDOR_HOSPITAL,LABORATORY_EXCEPT_IN_OR_AS_A_CLASSROOM,HEALTHCARE_FACILITY_OPERATING_ROOM]:`
            - Set applicability flag: `rule_applicability_check = FALSE`
    - Check if the applicability flag equals TRUE: `if rule_applicability_check == TRUE:`            
        - For each terminal in zone_p: `for terminal_p in zone_p.terminals:`
            - Get the served_by_heating_ventilation_air_conditioning_systems for each terminal: `heating_ventilation_air_conditioning_systems_p = terminal_p.served_by_heating_ventilation_air_conditioning_systems`
                - Add to list of heating_ventilation_air_conditioning_systems_p as the code loops through the terminal units: `heating_ventilation_air_conditioning_systems_list_p = heating_ventilation_air_conditioning_systems_list_p.append(heating_ventilation_air_conditioning_systems_p)`                    
    - Convert the list of heating_ventilation_air_conditioning_systems_list_p associated with the zone to a set and the back to a list to eliminate duplicates: `heating_ventilation_air_conditioning_systems_list_p = list(set(heating_ventilation_air_conditioning_systems_list_p))`
    - For each hvac_p in heating_ventilation_air_conditioning_systems_list_p: `for hvac_p in heating_ventilation_air_conditioning_systems_list_p:`                            
        - For each fan system in hvac_p: `for fan_system_p in hvac_p.fan_systems:`
            - Get fan system unoccupied operation control: `operation_during_unoccupied_p = fans_systems_p.operation_during_unoccupied`

        **Rule Assertion - Component:**
        - Case 1: For each applicable fan system, if fan system operation during unoccupied periods is continuous in the P_RMR: `if operation_during_unoccupied_p == “CONTINUOUS”: PASS`

        - Case 2: Else, for each applicable fan system, save hvac id to output array for failed components:`Else: FAIL and failed_component_array.append(hvac_p)`

**Rule Assertion - RMR:**

- Case 1: If all components pass in the P-RMR: `if ALL_COMPONENTS == PASS: PASS`

- Case 2 : Else if the applicability check equals FALSE: `else if len(applicable_hvac_systems_list_p) ==0: NOT APPLICABLE`

- Case 3: Else, list all failed components: `else: FAIL and raise_message ${failed_component_array}`              
            

**Applicability Checks:** 

1. Applies to zones in the P-RMR that do not have health and safety mandated minimum ventilation requirements during unoccupied hours.
2. Applies to zones in the P-RMR that are not computer rooms.
